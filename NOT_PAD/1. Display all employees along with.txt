FROM Dept d
LEFT JOIN Location l ON d.LOC_ID = l.LOC_ID;
 
3. Display all employees name, dept name, and the location name.
 
SELECT e.EMPNO, e.ENAME, e.JOB, d.DEPTNAME, l.LOC_NAME AS LOCATION_NAME
FROM Emp e
JOIN Dept d ON e.DEPTNO = d.ID
LEFT JOIN Location l ON d.LOC_ID = l.LOC_ID;
 
4. Find all deptnames, including those that do not belong to any location.
 
SELECT d.ID AS DEPTNO, d.DEPTNAME, l.LOC_NAME AS LOCATION_NAME

SELECT e.EMPNO, e.ENAME, e.JOB, d.DEPTNAME, l.LOC_NAME AS LOCATION_NAME
FROM Emp e
FULL OUTER JOIN Dept d ON e.DEPTNO = d.ID
FULL OUTER JOIN Location l ON d.LOC_ID = l.LOC_ID;
 
7.SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Depts_No_Emp
FROM Dept d
LEFT JOIN Emp e ON d.ID = e.DEPTNO
WHERE e.EMPNO IS NULL;
